<h3>Happy Birthday!</h3>
<h4><em>Here's your moose quote randomizer!</em></h4>

<p>Today, I created an array of moose quotes, and figured out <br>
    how to get a button click to bring up a new quote upon click,<br>
    using JQuery.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Moose Quotes</h1>

<em><p id="quote-random"></p></em>
<button id="quote-button">Get another quote!</button>
<script>

    var mooseQuotes = [
        "Be a moose.  Seriously.  It's great.",
        "If you ever see a moose in your garden, don't think it will attack you.  It probably just needs help with a computer problem as moose are not inherently tech-saavy.",
        "Behind every great man, is an angry moose, just getting ready to trample him.  Most of the time, those moose are invisible.",
        "I heart moose.",
        "Maybe moose are misunderstood.  Maybe my moose is miserable in the morning.  Majestic, magnificent, moose in mourning.",
        "Some moose look sad, but they are excellent at political machinations.  Withhold sympathy.",
        "Moose are the most delicate creatures imaginable, except that they are strong and scary, and they will kill you.",
        "My mother was a moose, but she got better.",
        "Moose moose moose moose cat? NO!!! Moose!"
    ];


    $('#quote-random').text(mooseQuotes[(Math.floor(Math.random() * (mooseQuotes.length + 1)))]);

    function randomQuotes() {
        console.log("You clicked my 'Moose Quotes' button!")
        $('#quote-random').text(mooseQuotes[(Math.floor(Math.random() * (mooseQuotes.length + 1)))]);
    }


    $('#quote-button').click(randomQuotes);
